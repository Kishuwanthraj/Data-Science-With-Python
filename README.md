* Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses `scientific methods`, `processes`, `algorithms and systems` to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data.
* Data science is related to data mining and big data.
* Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methodsin order to `understand and analyze actual phenomena with data`.
* Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.![Reference Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)
* Data science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths for skilled professionals. Today, successful data professionals understand that they must advance past the traditional skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. In order to uncover useful intelligence for their organizations, data scientists must master the full spectrum of the data science life cycle and possess a level of flexibility and understanding to maximize returns at each phase of the process.

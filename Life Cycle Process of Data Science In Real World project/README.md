* Data Science Process (DSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. 
* DSP helps improve team collaboration and learning by suggesting how team roles work best together. 
* DSP includes best practices and structures from Company and other industry leaders to help toward successful implementation of data science initiatives. 
* The goal is to help companies fully realize the benefits of their analytics program.


### Data science lifecycle
* The Data Science Process (DSP) provides a lifecycle to structure the development of your data science projects. 
* The lifecycle outlines the full steps that successful projects follow.

* If you are using another data science lifecycle, such as CRISP-DM, KDD, or your organization's own custom process, you can still use the task-based DSP in the context of those development lifecycles.
* At a high level, these different methodologies have much in common.
* This lifecycle has been designed for data science projects that ship as part of intelligent applications. 
* These applications deploy machine learning or artificial intelligence models for predictive analytics. 
* Exploratory data science projects or improvised analytics projects can also benefit from using this process. 
* But in such cases some of the steps described may not be needed.
***
* The lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Acquisition and Understanding
3. Modeling
4. Deployment
5. Customer Acceptance

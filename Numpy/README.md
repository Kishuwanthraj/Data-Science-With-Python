## Numpy
---
* The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* Nearly every scientist working in Python draws on the power of NumPy.
* NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.
